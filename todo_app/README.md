## 3.9 DBaaS vs DIY

When deploying PostgreSQL on Google Cloud, there are two main options:

- **DBaaS (Database as a Service)** â€” use **Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL**, a fully managed database.
- **DIY (Do It Yourself)** â€” deploy your own PostgreSQL container inside **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, using **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)** for storage.

The table below compares the two approaches across setup, maintenance, backup, cost, and control.

| # | Category | Subtopic | **DBaaS (Cloud SQL)** | **DIY (Postgres on GKE)** |
|:-:|:----------|:----------|:----------------------|:---------------------------|
| **1** | **Setup & Initialization** | Setup time | Quick and automated setup via Google Console or `gcloud`. | Requires building Docker images, writing manifests, and setting up Services and PVCs. |
|  |  | Configuration | Managed automatically â€” replication, scaling, and patching handled by Google. | Must be manually configured and tuned in YAML or Helm charts. |
| **2** | **Maintenance** | Patching & upgrades | Google handles updates and patching automatically. | Must be done manually â€” can cause downtime if not automated. |
|  |  | Monitoring & logging | Integrated with Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging. | Requires setup of Prometheus, Grafana, or similar tools. |
|  |  | High availability | Built-in multi-zone failover and automatic replication. | Needs StatefulSets and custom HA setup. |
| **3** | **Backups & Recovery** | Automatic backups | Built-in automated daily backups and PITR (point-in-time recovery). | Must create CronJobs or manual scripts using `pg_dump` to a bucket. |
|  |  | Restore process | One-click restore via console or API. | Manual restore of PVCs or import from dump file. |
| **4** | **Cost** | Billing model | Pay per instance uptime and managed service overhead. | Pay for compute (nodes) and storage only; cheaper but requires ops time. |
|  |  | Scaling cost | Easy vertical/horizontal scaling, but more expensive for large databases. | Scaling possible but complex and manual; needs Kubernetes tuning. |
| **5** | **Control & Flexibility** | Access level | Limited â€” no superuser or OS-level access. | Full root and configuration access; can install any extensions. |
|  |  | Portability | Locked to Google Cloud. | Portable to any Kubernetes cluster. |
| **6** | **Overall Evaluation** | Best use case | Ideal for **production** systems requiring reliability and minimal ops. | Ideal for **learning**, **testing**, or custom database configurations. |

### **Summary**

| **Area** | **Best Option** |
|:----------|:----------------|
| Ease of setup & maintenance | âœ… **DBaaS (Cloud SQL)** |
| Customization & control | âœ… **DIY (Postgres on GKE)** |
| Cost efficiency (small scale) | âœ… **DIY** |
| Reliability, backups, HA | âœ… **DBaaS** |
| Learning & experimentation | âœ… **DIY** |

### **Conclusion**

- **DBaaS (Google Cloud SQL)** â€” best suited for production use where uptime, backup automation, and ease of management are priorities.  
- **DIY (Postgres on GKE)** â€” better for developers or teams who need more control and want to learn Kubernetes database operations.
